Pokémon Image Finder using Fetch API

This project is a JavaScript practice application built to demonstrate the use of the Fetch API and asynchronous programming. The application allows users to enter the name of a Pokémon in a text input field and displays the corresponding Pokémon image dynamically below the input.

Features:-
-> Fetches Pokémon data from a public API using fetch()
> Displays Pokémon image based on user input
-> Handles invalid Pokémon names gracefully
-> Uses asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)
-> Simple and responsive user interface

Concepts Used:-
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Fetch API
-Async / Await

How It Works:-
1. The user enters a Pokémon name in the input field.
2. The application sends a request to the Pokémon API using the Fetch API.
3. The response is processed and the Pokémon image is extracted.
4. The image is displayed dynamically below the input field.
5. If the Pokémon name is invalid, an error message is shown.
